## üéÜ Installation

To install Fluent, you can download the official Fluent installer from the **Releases** pages.
Once the installer shows that the installation was successful, you may need to restart your terminal for changes to take effect.

- **On Windows**: Just close and re-open the terminal (CMD, PowerShell, etc.)
- **On Linux/macOS**: Execute `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` depending on your shell

## üöÄ Getting Started

To create a new Fluent project, you can use the `fluent init` command. This will create a new Fluent project in the current directory.

> **NOTE:** Make sure the current directory is empty before running the `fluent init` command, otherwise, add a name after the command to create a new directory with the project name, e.g. `fluent init my_project`.

```shell
fluent init
```

You will be prompted to fill relevant information about your project like project name, author, etc.
Once you've filled in the information, the project will be created and you can start coding!

**Example structure:**

```
my_project/
    src/
        main.fluent
    Fluent.yml
    .gitignore
```

To run your code use:

```
fluent run
```
