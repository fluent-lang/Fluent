- Simple syntax
- Flexible standard libraries
- Easily package your app into an executable
- And more!

## üéÜ Installation

To install Zyro, you can download the official Zyro installer from the **Releases** pages.
Once the installer shows that the installation was successful, you may need to restart your terminal for changes to take effect.

- **On Windows**: Just close and re-open the terminal (CMD, PowerShell, etc.)
- **On Linux/macOS**: Execute `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` depending on your shell

## üöÄ Getting Started

To create a new Zyro project, you can use the `zyro init` command. This will create a new Zyro project in the current directory.

> **NOTE:** Make sure the current directory is empty before running the `zyro init` command, otherwise, add a name after the command to create a new directory with the project name, e.g. `zyro init my_project`.

```shell
zyro init
```

You will be prompted to fill relevant information about your project like project name, author, etc.
Once you've filled in the information, the project will be created and you can start coding!

**Example structure:**

```
my_project/
    src/
        main.zyro
    Zyro.yml
    .gitignore
```
